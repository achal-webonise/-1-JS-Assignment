    <!-- Explain the differences between the freeze and seal method of Object. -->
                           <!-- Object.freeze()           -->

    <!-- Prevents the addition of new properties to the object.
         Prevents the removal of existing properties from the object.
         Prevents changes to the existing properties of the object.
         Returns the object that was frozen.    -->

                           <!-- Object.seal()     -->
                           
    <!-- Prevents the addition of new properties to the object.
         Prevents the removal of existing properties from the object.
         Allows changes to the existing properties of the object.
         Returns the object that was sealed. -->

<!--   How can you determine if an object has been sealed or frozen in JavaScript? Provide an
  example of how you might check this programmatically. -->

  <!-- We can use the Object.isSealed() and Object.isFrozen() methods 
    to determine if an object has been sealed or frozen.

Object.isSealed() returns true if an object is sealed, 
it cannot have new properties added to it. It returns false otherwise.

Object.isFrozen() returns true if an object is frozen, it cannot have new properties added to it and its existing properties cannot be changed. 
It returns false otherwise. -->

<!-- /////////////////////////////////////// -->

  <!-- Discuss potential use cases for using seal and freeze in JavaScript applications. When might
  you choose one method over the other
   -->

   <!-- We have to consider the level of protection that is needed before selecting between object.seal()
   and object.freeze(). If we only want to prevent the addition or removal of properties, 
   but still allow changes to existing properties, then object.seal() is the appropriate method to use.
   On the other hand, if you want to prevent all modifications to the object, then object.freeze() is the better choice. -->
